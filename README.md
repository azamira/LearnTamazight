#Learn Tamazight Moodle Website

This repository contains updates on the creation of a Moodle website for learning the Tamazight language. 

##Installation

We originally encountered a compatibility problem with macOS 10.15. The installation finally succeeded after manually modifying the original installation package provided by moodle and replacing the Mamp server with the latest release.

Moodle Version: Moodle 3.8
